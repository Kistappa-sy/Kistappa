Go to Script Console under Manage Jenkins, this script will print the name of all jobs including jobs inside of a folder and the folders themselves:

  Jenkins.instance.getAllItems(AbstractItem.class).each {
  	println(it.fullName)
  };
This script will print the name of all jobs including jobs inside of a folder, but not the folders themselves.

  Jenkins.instance.getAllItems(Job.class).each{ 
  println it.name + " - " + it.class
  }
This script will recursively print the name of all jobs implementing the AbstractProject class, i.e. Freestyle and Maven jobs.

  Jenkins.instance.getAllItems(AbstractProject.class).each {it ->
    println it.fullName;
  }
  
  
 To get the job list  from DD-MM-YY to DD-MM-YY
